When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local? 

A remote repository is usefull both for colaborative work and
for sharing a file among multiple development sites.(Compare to dropbox)

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If commits to a remote repository need to be vetted before integration.
