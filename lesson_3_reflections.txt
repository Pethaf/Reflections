When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local? 

A remote repository is usefull both for colaborative work and
for sharing a file among multiple development sites.(Compare to dropbox)

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If commits to a remote repository need to be vetted before integration. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another? 

A fork is a clone that happens on github. This is used when a copy of a repository on github is wanted, with propper attribution to the original author. 
A clone is a copy of a repository, including all commit history. This is used when a copy of a repository that is not necessarily on github. 
A branch is a divergence in the linear history of a commit. This is useful if an experimental feature is demanded or if multiple collaborators work on different features in the same 
commit tree.
