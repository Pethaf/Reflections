What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it? 

The .git subdirectory is created, and populated. It is needed for (among other things) storing delta-files to manage history, 
and signaling to GIT that this directory is a git repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers? 

The staging area is where tracked files that aren't yet commited to the repository are saved. This is usefull because it offers a second chance to regret any additions, and in the case of a remote repository it also facilitates working offline, and then commiting the history when connectivity is restored.
